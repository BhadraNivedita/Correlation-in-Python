# WHat is Correlation test in statistics?

Correlation tests are statistical methods used to quantify the strength and direction of the relationship between two or more variables. They are commonly used to assess associations between variables in various fields, including statistics, economics, biology, and, social sciences. Here are some different correlation tests:

**Pearson Correlation Coefficient (Pearson's r)**:

Pearson's correlation measures the linear relationship between two continuous variables. It ranges from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to 1 (perfect positive correlation), with 0 indicating no linear correlation.
Assumptions: Variables should be approximately normally distributed, and the relationship should be linear.


**Spearman Rank Correlation (Spearman's ρ)**:

Spearman's correlation assesses the strength and direction of a monotonic (non-linear) relationship between two variables. It is based on the ranks of data points rather than the raw data.
Assumptions: Variables should be ordinal, interval, or ratio scale; non-linear relationships are acceptable.

**Kendall's Tau (Kendall's τ)**:

Kendall's Tau is another rank-based correlation coefficient used to measure the strength and direction of association between two variables. It is often used when data are not normally distributed.
Assumptions: Like Spearman's, Kendall's Tau is suitable for ordinal, interval, or ratio data.

**Point-Biserial Correlation**:

Point-biserial correlation is used when one variable is binary (e.g., yes/no) and the other is continuous. It quantifies the strength and direction of the association between the two variables.
Assumptions: The continuous variable should be approximately normally distributed.

**Phi Coefficient (ϕ)**:

The phi coefficient measures the association between two binary variables (usually coded as 0 and 1). It is similar to Pearson's correlation but is specific to binary data.
Assumptions: Both variables should be binary.

**Cramer's V**:

Cramer's V is used to measure the strength of association between two nominal variables. It is an extension of the phi coefficient for variables with more than two categories.
Assumptions: Both variables should be nominal.

**Polychoric Correlation**:

Polychoric correlation is used to assess the association between two ordinal variables by estimating a correlation coefficient that assumes an underlying bivariate normal distribution.
Assumptions: Both variables should be ordinal.


**Partial correlation**:
Partial correlation is a statistical technique used to measure the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables while controlling for the influence of one or more additional variables, often referred to as "covariates" or "control variables." In other words, partial correlation assesses the association between two variables while holding the effects of other variables constant.
