# WHat is Correlation test in statistics?

Correlation tests are statistical methods used to quantify the strength and direction of the relationship between two or more variables. They are commonly used to assess associations between variables in various fields, including statistics, economics, biology, and, social sciences. Here are some different correlation tests:

**Pearson Correlation Coefficient (Pearson's r)**:

Pearson's correlation measures the linear relationship between two continuous variables. It ranges from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to 1 (perfect positive correlation), with 0 indicating no linear correlation.
Assumptions: Variables should be approximately normally distributed, and the relationship should be linear.


**Spearman Rank Correlation (Spearman's ρ)**:

Spearman's correlation assesses the strength and direction of a monotonic (non-linear) relationship between two variables. It is based on the ranks of data points rather than the raw data.
Assumptions: Variables should be ordinal, interval, or ratio scale; non-linear relationships are acceptable.

**Kendall's Tau (Kendall's τ)**:

Kendall's Tau is another rank-based correlation coefficient used to measure the strength and direction of association between two variables. It is often used when data are not normally distributed.
Assumptions: Like Spearman's, Kendall's Tau is suitable for ordinal, interval, or ratio data.

**Point-Biserial Correlation**:

Point-biserial correlation is used when one variable is binary (e.g., yes/no) and the other is continuous. It quantifies the strength and direction of the association between the two variables.
Assumptions: The continuous variable should be approximately normally distributed.
